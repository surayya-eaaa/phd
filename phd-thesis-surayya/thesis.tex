% class with lots of nice features. Please read the memoir manual and
% familiarize yourself with its basics.
%
% For example, use the \Sref (section ref), \fref (figure ref)
% etc. to reference labels. This will yield uniform naming.
%
% Also, use \includeonly to selectively include only parts of the thesis.
